# PyBer_Analysis
Create data visualizations using python data, pandas library and Matplot library

## Overview of the analysis
As a newly hired Data analyst at a python based ride sharing app *PyBer*, this analysis requires creating data visualization to help find insights about the app access and ride charges based on city type. The exploratory analysis on large data stored in csv files will show the relationships between the type of city, total number of drivers and the total fares. Further, the analysis will also determine average fare per ride and per driver based on city type.

## Results
